    Created a new public local repository on my Github account.

    When writing my code using VScode, I ensured I committed my changes to my local repository in regular intervals, using clear messaging for any changes I had made.
    
        git add .
        
        git commit -m "message"

        after making the commits, I would push   to  my remote repository using "git push"

        
Deployment

Using Github to deploy my project.



    Created a new public local repository on my Github account, and copied the repository to VScode to start building the website.

        When writing my code using VScode, I ensured I committed my changes to my local repository in regular intervals, using clear messaging for any changes I had made.
        git add .
        git commit -m "This would be my message on what I had changed"

    After making my regular commits, I would then push the commits to my remote repository by using the command 'git push'.

Hosting

    To host my website, I went to Github and selected my repository named Mindfulness-Kids-Club-TwentyTwentyFive .
    I went to Settings > Pages
    I made sure the following settings were applied:
        Source: 'Deploy from a branch' on the dropdown menu
        Branch: 'Main' and 'root' from the dropdown menus
        Pressed save
    This takes a few minutes to deploy, and will be found on the righthand-side of the repository dashboard page.
